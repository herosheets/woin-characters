It cannot be performed again until at least one hour has been spent maintaining the FTL engines."
Ricochet ,,You can pay 4d6 to “bounce” a ranged attack off of one surface in order to hit a target to whom you would not normally have line of sight. This does not negate the target's cover bonuses; it merely creates a line of sight to a target where there previously was none.

The device only functions in this way for a single action before becoming permanently useless."
Varied,,"Lots of variety"
Warp maneuver,,"A very dangerous maneuver, you use your ship's FTL capability to reposition your ship on the battlemap. You can move to any location to which you have direct line-of-sight, but your resultant facing is randomized (roll 1d6). This takes your ship's FTL engines offline, and they require an hour to repair."
Whirlwind frenzy,,"You attack all adjacent targets, but only do 1d6 damage to each. This costs you 3d6. You must still make an attack roll against each target. If you hit every target, all targets are pushed back 5', clearing a space around you."
